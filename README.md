# About
This will be a microservice built with three APIS: the first built with Laravel, the second with NodeJS + Sequelize and the last with NodeJS + Mongoose.
Laravel will be used to build the Api Gateway, accessible via formulary, and to interact with the other APIS will be used a Token JWT that will be generated inside the system.
